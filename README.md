.Net Wrapper for Orb Media Streaming API
========================================

What?
-----
Assembly for .net applications to talk to the Orb media streaming service

Why?
----
Bored and wanted easy access to orb's api

Found an old vb.net project (sadly ive lost the link) and wanted to c# it up to learn more about using api's

Technology:
-----------
Code converted to c# from original vb project.  Half the code now uses the old stuff while a lot of refactoring has taken place to try and streamline the code.
Rest Sharp is used to communicate with the api and serialise the responses into nice data models for easy use in your .net applications.


All of the basic stuff is there the project just needs time to be completed - but so far you can authenticate, keep session alive, search and sort media, and most importantly - play media
